NOTES:

The requirements of contracts imply no undefined behavior.

End-users of the project may observe behavior changes. For developers, the
contracts further includes ahead-of-time build characteristics such as static
assertions but not runtime observable behavior like runtime assertions.

Being conforming to the interface specification implies contracts on that
interface are not violated.

Expected "correct" behavior would only be achived when the corresponding
interface specifications are not violated and the behavior of external
environment remains also predicatable.

Certain kinds of modifications of the library provide explicit backward
compatibility on API and/or ABI level. If not mentioned, ABI stability is not
preserved.
If ABI remains compatibile, there would be no need to deploy new
binary code.
If API remains compatible, there would be no need for library users to modify
code using to adapt to the modification unless they depend on the new interface.
Since additions of interface might intefere with valid working code (e.g. with
SFINAE checks), so unless specified otherwise, they do not fall into the
category of not requiring the user code to be modified.
