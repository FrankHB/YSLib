libmagic(https://github.com/glensc/file): rejected.
	This library implements a DSL(with BNF provided among the source files) for querying magic number database. It is heavyweight and too complex for freestanding implementations.
	Stripping the code of extended functionality(other than MIME detection needed by YFramework) out is difficult, because functions for printing and parameters for state passing are spread in the call graph deeply.
	For hosted implementations, operation system or desktop environment based implementations may provide alternative more benifical interfaces for integrating custom/user-specified information of content types.
	Also the depolying overhead of the magic databace files is significant.
	For these reasons, this library is not suitable for YFramework, though may be fit for the low level indirect implentation esp. on POSIX systems.
