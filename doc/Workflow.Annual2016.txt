report.impl:
Overloaded function templates for 'std::size' works as expected only with core issue resolutions.
	The overloaded version for array accept non-static member access of array type depends on the change in CWG616 available in ISO C++14, which forbids it to be a prvalue.
	The deduction for 'std::initializer_list' instance for overloaded version for array depends on the resolution of CWG1591.
