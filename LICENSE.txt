Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed without written permission.

Preamble

This file is the overall license document of the YSLib Project.

This document is for the current version. See LICENSE_HISTORY.txt about licenses for history versions.

This document contains multiple options of license application combination.

The copyright notice above, as well as the clauses of basic permissions and the disclaimer, are intended to be equivalent to the license derived from the template of BSD 2-Clause license (https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html) in legal effects. This is treated as the minimal basis of this document, applicable for all works not covered by other required licenses for external dependencies.

Although not strictly required, it is recommended to redistribute this document instead of the minimal terms and conditions implied.

Otherwise, if the minimal basis is retained, it is permitted to have differences conforming to following rules:

	The word "shall" in the subclauses may be replaced by the word "must".

	The equivalent replacements established in SPDX License List Matching Guidelines, v2.1 (https://spdx.dev/license-list/matching-guidelines/) are allowed, such as:

		The copyright sign (©) in the copyright notice may be replaced by alternative equivalent expressions.

		Ordinals may be added to the subclauses.

	Any other visible texts in the subclauses are kept verbatim, or kept in a form allowing to reproduce the texts with the replacements in the rule above.

The permission of replacements above allows appliations of the minimal basis to denote the license in compatible ways of BSD 2-Clause license without a copy of this document, for example, by using a SPDX identifier defined in https://spdx.org/licenses/ or ISO/IEC 5962:2021.
