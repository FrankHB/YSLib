This is the repository of YDE(YSLib Desktop Environment).

Currently there are only standalone packages.

Run "build-all.sh" to traverse this directory and build all packages using "SHBuild-BuildApp.sh".
Run "../Tools/Scripts/install-sysroot.sh" to get a workable sysroot. Make sure "SHBuild-BuildApp.sh" is in $PATH.

Depending on sysroot, currently only MinGW32 is supported.

For all GUI program with no title bar, right click to exit if not other specified.
